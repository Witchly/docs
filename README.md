# 👋 Welcome to Witchly!

#### 🧙‍♂️ What is Witchly?

Think of us as the "engine" that powers your game world.

Witchly is a premium game-server hosting platform founded in 2021. We exist for one reason: to let you play with your friends without any lag, crash, or headaches—all at a price that doesn't break your piggy bank 🐷.

#### 🎮 What can I play?

We support all the community favorites. If you want to play it, we probably host it:

* ⛏️ Minecraft (The Classic):
  * Java Edition: For PC players.
  * Bedrock Edition: For Mobile, Console, and Windows 10 players.
  * Modded or Vanilla: Whether you want the clean original game or crazy mods (like RLCraft or Pixelmon), we support it all.
* 🔫 Rust: Survive the wild with your clan.
* 🐼 Palworld: Catch Pals, build bases, and explore.
* ✨ HYTALE (🔥 NEW!):
  * _The Open Beta just released on Jan 13th!_
  * We are one of the only hosts in the world supporting Hytale right now. Be the first of your friends to run a private Hytale world.

#### 🚀 Why choose us?

We don't use old, slow computers. When you buy a server from us, you are renting a slice of a Beast Machine.

* Brain Power: We use Intel i9 9900k processors (these are super fast!).
* Memory: We have 128GB of RAM to handle as many explosions as you can make.
* Speed: We use 2TB NVMe Storage. This means your world loads instantly. No waiting.

#### 👶 Is this difficult?

Nope! That is exactly why we wrote these docs.

You do not need to know how to code. You do not need to be a "hacker." If you know how to turn on a PC and open a browser, you are already over-qualified.

#### 🗺️ Your Journey Starts Here

This website is your map. We will guide you through three simple steps:

1. 🛒 Buying: How to pick the right plan for your game.
2. ⚙️ Setup: How to turn your server on with one click.
3. 🎮 Playing: How to invite your friends and join the game.

#### 💡 Strategy Note on Hytale:

Since Hytale is brand new (Open Beta Jan 13th) and rare, you might want to consider adding a small "Hytale" badge or label in your GitBook sidebar navigation next to the "Buying" section later on, so people spot it immediately!
