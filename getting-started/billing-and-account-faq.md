# 💳 Billing & Account FAQ

#### ⬆️ How to Upgrade RAM

Need more power? You don't need to buy a new server! You can upgrade instantly without losing any data.

1. Go to the Billing Area (billing.witchly.host).
2. Click Services > My Services.
3. Click on your active server.
4. On the left (or under Actions), click Upgrade/Downgrade.
5. Choose the new plan you want.
6. Pay: The system will calculate the difference (pro-rated). You only pay for the remaining days of the month!
7. Restart: Go to your Game Panel and Restart the server to unlock the new RAM.

#### ❌ How to Cancel

We are sad to see you go, but we make it easy. No hidden tricks.

1. Go to Billing Area > My Services.
2. Click on the server you want to stop.
3. Click Request Cancellation.
4. Immediate vs. End of Billing:
   * _Immediate:_ Deletes the server NOW. (Careful! This deletes your files instantly).
   * _End of Billing:_ Keeps the server running until the day you already paid for, then stops it.

#### ❓ Suspended?

If your server says "Suspended", it means the invoice wasn't paid on the due date.

* Don't Panic: Your files are safe for a few days!
* Fix: Just pay the unpaid invoice, and the server will turn back on instantly.
