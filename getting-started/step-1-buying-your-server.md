  We know that technical terms like "RAM" or "NVMe" can be confusing. That is
  why we built the Smart Selector. You don't need to do any math—our website
  calculates exactly what you need!

# 🛒 Step 1: Buying Your Server

#### 1. Go to the Pricing Page

Click here to open our main pricing page: 👉 [Pricing Page](https://witchly.host/pricing)

#### 2. Use the "Smart Selector" 🧠

At the top of the page, look for the purple box. Just tell it what you want to play:

1. I want to host: Select your game (e.g., Minecraft, Hytale, Rust).
2. Server Type: Are you playing normal (Vanilla) or with Mods?
3. Estimated Players: Drag the purple slider to match how many friends will join.

✨ Magic: The website will automatically highlight the best plan for you!
