# 📧 Step 3: Activation & Password

#### 1. Check Your Email

Go to your email inbox (the one you just used to sign up). You are looking for an email from Witchly Host.

It will contain a special link to the Game Panel.

* Click the link inside that email to set up your account.

#### 2. Set Your Panel Password 🔐

⚠️ Crucial Step: When you click the link, it will ask you to Create a Password.

* New Password: Type a strong password.
* Confirm Password: Type it again.

> 📝 Note: This password is for your Game Panel (where you play). It can be different from your Billing password.

#### 3. You are In! 🚀

Once you click save, you will be logged into the panel automatically. You will see your new server sitting there, ready to be turned on!
