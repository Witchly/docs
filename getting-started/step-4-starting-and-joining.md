# 🕹️ Step 4: Starting & Joining

#### 2. The "Start" Button 🟢

Look for the big purple button that says "Start".

* Click it!
* You will see a lot of text scrolling by in the black box. This is normal! It means the server is waking up.
* Wait until the button turns Green and says "Online".

> ⚠️ First Time Note: The very first time you start a server, it might take 1-2 minutes to download all the game files. Be patient!

#### 3. Get Your Address (IP) 🗺️

To join the game, you need your "Server Address." Look at the top right corner (or under the server name). You will see a button that says Address or IP.

* It looks something like this: `192.168.0.1:6969`or `play.witchly.host:25565`.
* Click to Copy that address.
