# 🔄 Changing Server Version: Hytale

1. Go to your Witchly Panel.
2. Stop the server.
3. Go to the "Startup" tab (or "Settings").
4. Look for a button or toggle that says "Auto Update" or "Update on Start".
   * _Set this to ON._
5. Start the server.
   * The console will say: `Checking for updates...` and download the latest patch automatically.

Rolling Back (Previous Version) _Currently, Hytale does not officially support "Downgrading" to older beta builds easily, as the master servers usually require all clients to be on the latest version._

> ⚠️ World Compatibility: Just like Minecraft, if you update your world to a new version, you usually cannot go back. Always make a Backup before updating!
