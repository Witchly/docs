  The best part? Mods on Hytale are server-side

# 🔌 Installing Mods on Hytale

> ⚠️ No Egg Switching: Mods are specific to the Hytale version you are running. If you want to change your core game version, remember that you'll need to replace the server files as users cannot change "Eggs" manually.

### 🛠️ How Hytale Modding Works

Witchly servers handle all the heavy lifting for your community. Because mods are server-side, they enhance your world with new mechanics and features while keeping the entry barrier zero for your players.

### 📤 Method 1: Manual Upload (.zip)

Have a custom mod or one not found on CurseForge? You can upload your own `.zip` files directly to our nodes (like `germany-1.witchly.host`).

1. Go to the Files tab in your Witchly Panel.
2. Locate the `/mods` folder.
3. Drag and drop your `.zip` mod files directly into the browser or use the Upload button.
4. Once the upload is finished, Restart the server from the Console.

### 🩺 Troubleshooting

| **Issue**               | **Solution**                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mod Not Loading         | Ensure the file is in the correct `/mods` folder and that the server was restarted.                                              |
| Server Crashing         | Some mods conflict with each other. Try removing them one by one to find the "Final Boss" causing the crash.                     |
| Player Connection Error | While mods are server-side, some very specific "Total Conversion" mods might require a specific Hytale version. Check your logs! |
