# 📜 Commands Cheat Sheet

#### ⚡ How to use commands

There are two ways to use these:

1. In-Game: Press `T` or `/` to open chat. Type the command (start with `/`).
2. In Console: Go to your Witchly Panel > Console. Type the command without the `/`.

***

#### 👮‍♂️ Managing Players (The "Ban Hammer")

Keep your server safe from griefers.

| **Command**      | **What it does**                          | **Example**         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `/op [name]`     | Make Admin. Gives a player full power.    | `/op Steve`         |
| `/deop [name]`   | Remove Admin. Takes away their power.     | `/deop Steve`       |
| `/kick [name]`   | Kick. Disconnects them (they can rejoin). | `/kick Alex`        |
| `/ban [name]`    | Ban. Kicks them and blocks them forever.  | `/ban Herobrine`    |
| `/pardon [name]` | Unban. Forgives a banned player.          | `/pardon Herobrine` |

***

#### 🛡️ The Whitelist (Private Server)

Want to make your server "Invite Only"? Turn on the Whitelist.

1. Turn it on: `/whitelist on`
2. Add a friend: `/whitelist add [name]`
3. Remove a friend: `/whitelist remove [name]`
4. See the list: `/whitelist list`

> 💡 Tip: If you turn the whitelist ON, nobody can join unless you add them first!

***

#### 🎮 Game Modes & Fun

Change how the game is played.

| **Command**                  | **What it does**                             |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `/gamemode creative [name]`  | Gives them infinite blocks & flying.         |
| `/gamemode survival [name]`  | Normal Minecraft (Hearts & Hunger).          |
| `/gamemode spectator [name]` | They become a ghost (can fly through walls). |

***

#### ☀️ Time & Weather

Is it raining? Is it too dark? Fix it instantly.

* Make it Day: `/time set day`
* Make it Night: `/time set night`
* Stop the Rain: `/weather clear`
* Make it Storm: `/weather thunder`

***

#### 🛑 Saving & Stopping

Always use these before you close the server!

* Save the World: `/save-all` (Forces the server to save map data).
* Stop Safely: `/stop` (The best way to turn off your server).
