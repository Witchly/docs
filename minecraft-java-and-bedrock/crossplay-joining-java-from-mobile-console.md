  Play together, no matter the device. 🤝 By default, Minecraft Java (PC) and
  Bedrock (Phone/Xbox/Switch) cannot play together. But with Geyser, you can fix
  that!

# 📱 Crossplay: Joining Java from Mobile/Console

#### 1. Installation (The 1-Click Way)

The easiest way to enable crossplay is using our Plugin Manager.

1. Your server must be running Paper, Spigot, or Purpur (Not Vanilla!).
2. Go to the "Plugins" tab in your Panel.
3. Search for `GeyserMC` (or just `Geyser`).
4. Click Install.
5. Search for `Floodgate`. (This lets Bedrock players join without a Java account).
6. Click Install.
7. Restart your server.

#### 2. How Bedrock Players Join 📲

Bedrock players connect a little differently.

* Server Name: Any name.
* Server Address: Your Server IP (e.g., `germany-1.witchly.host`).
* Port:
  * _Option A:_ Try the same port as the Java server (e.g., `25565`).
  * _Option B:_ If that fails, check your Console startup logs for "Geyser started on port..." and use that number.
