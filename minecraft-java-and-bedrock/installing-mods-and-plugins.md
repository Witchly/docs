# 🧩 Installing Mods & Plugins

#### 🤔 First: What is the difference?

* Plugins: Small additions (like /sethome or Economy).
  * _Requirement:_ Your server must be running Paper, Spigot, or Purpur.
  * _Do players need to install anything?_ NO. Just join and play!
* Mods: Big changes (like Dragons, Cars, Machines).
  * _Requirement:_ Your server must be running Forge or Fabric.
  * _Do players need to install anything?_ YES. Everyone playing must install the exact same mods on their own PC.

#### ⚡ Method 1: The 1-Click Plugin Installer

_Best for: Spigot/Paper servers._

Forget downloading files! You can install plugins directly from our panel.

1. Go to your Witchly Panel.
2. Look for the "Plugin Manager" or "Plugins" tab in the sidebar.
3. Search: Type the name of the plugin (e.g., "EssentialsX", "WorldEdit", "Geyser").
4. Click Install: Hit the button and wait a second.
5. Restart: Go to the Console and restart your server to turn them on.

#### 📦 Method 2: The 1-Click Modpack Installer

_Best for: Playing big modpacks like RLCraft or Pixelmon._

Instead of installing 200 mods one by one, let our robots do it instantly.

1. Go to your Panel.
2. Look for the "Modpacks" or "Softwares" tab.
3. Search: Find the pack you want (e.g., "All The Mods 9").
4. Click Install.
   * _⚠️ Warning: This will delete your current world to make room for the new modpack. Make sure you don't have anything important saved!_
5. Start Server: It might take 5-10 minutes to download everything the first time.

#### 🛠️ Method 3: Manual Installation (Advanced)

_Use this ONLY if you can't find the mod/plugin in our 1-Click installer._

Sometimes you want a specific mod that isn't popular yet. You can still do it the old-fashioned way!

1. Download it: Get the `.jar` file from CurseForge or Modrinth.
2. Upload it:
   * Go to Files.
   * Open the `plugins` folder (for Plugins) OR the `mods` folder (for Mods).
   * Drag and drop your file there.
3. Restart: Restart the server.
