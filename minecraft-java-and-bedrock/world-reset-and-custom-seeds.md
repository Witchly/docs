# 🗺️ World Reset & Custom Seeds

#### 🗑️ How to Reset the World

1. Stop your server.
2. Go to the Files tab.
3. Delete the folder named `world`.
   * _Note: If you have a Nether or End, also delete `world_nether` and `world_the_end`._
4. Start the server. It will generate a brand new world folder instantly.

#### 🏔️ How to use a Custom Seed

1. Go to Files and open `server.properties`.
2. Find the line: `level-seed=`
3. Type your seed (e.g., `level-seed=8675309`).
4. Save Content.
5. Important: You must delete your existing `world` folder (see above) for the new seed to generate!
