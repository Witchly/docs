# 🆘 How to Get Help Fast

#### ❌ The "Bad" Ticket

> "My server is broken. Fix it."

* _Why this is bad:_ We don't know _what_ is broken. Is it crashing? Lagging? Can't join? This forces us to ask 10 questions before we can even start fixing it.

#### ✅ The "Perfect" Ticket

> "I can't start my server. I installed the 'RLCraft' modpack, and now when I click Start, it crashes after 10 seconds. Here is a screenshot of the error."

* _Why this is good:_ We know exactly what you did (Modpack) and what happened (Crash). We can fix this in minutes!

#### 📝 What to include

1. The Error Message: Copy-paste the error from your Console.
2. Screenshots: A picture is worth 1000 words. Show us what you see!
3. What you changed: Did you just add a new plugin? Did you change a setting? Tell us!
