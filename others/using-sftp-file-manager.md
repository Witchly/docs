  Move big files fast. 🚀 The standard "File Manager" in your browser is great
  for small edits, but if you want to upload a massive world, modpack, or
  backup, you need SFTP.

# 📂 Using SFTP (File Manager)

#### 1. What you need

You need a "FTP Client" installed on your PC. We recommend:

* WinSCP (Windows) - _Best option!_
* FileZilla (Mac/Windows)
* Cyberduck (Mac)

#### 2. Get your Credentials

1. Go to your Witchly Panel.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab in the sidebar.
3. Look for the "SFTP Details" box. You will see:
   * Server Address: (e.g., `sftp.witchly.host:2022`)
   * Username: (e.g., `u1234.name`)

#### 3. Connect! 🔌

1. Open your FTP program (e.g., WinSCP).
2. Host Name: Paste the Server Address (without the `sftp://` part).
3. Port: Paste the port number (usually `2022`).
4. Username: Paste the username from the panel.
5. Password: Use your Panel Login Password.
   * _(Note: This is the same password you use to log into the website)._
6. Click Login or Connect.

> 💡 Pro Tip: If you use WinSCP, you can just click the "Launch SFTP" button in the Settings tab, and it will open the program for you automatically!
