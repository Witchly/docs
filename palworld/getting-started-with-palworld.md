  Gotta catch 'em all... with guns. 🔫 Palworld servers are easy to set up, but
  joining them requires a specific trick because the in-game server browser is
  often crowded.

# 🐼 Getting Started with Palworld

#### 🎮 How to Join (Direct Connect)

The best way to join your server is by using your IP address.

1. Open Palworld.
2. Click "Join Multiplayer Game".
3. Look at the bottom of the screen. You will see a box that says 127.0.0.1:8211.
4. Delete that text.
5. Paste your Witchly IP: (e.g., `192.168.1.1:8211`).
6. Click Connect.

> ⚠️ Connection Error? If it says "Connection Timed Out" or "Password Invalid":
>
> * Make sure the server is Online (Green).
> * If you set a Server Password, you must check the "Enter Password" checkbox next to the Connect button _before_ you click Connect!

#### 👑 How to Become Admin

Unlike Minecraft, there is no "Console Command" to make you Op. You must use an Admin Password.

Step 1: Set the Password

1. Go to your Witchly Panel > Startup tab.
2. Find the box labeled "Admin Password".
3. Type a secure password (e.g., `WitchlyRules`).
4. Restart the server.

Step 2: Log In In-Game

1. Join your server.
2. Press Enter to open chat.
3. Type this command: `/AdminPassword YourPassword`
   * _Example:_ `/AdminPassword WitchlyRules`
4. Press Enter.
   * _If nothing happens, it worked! (Palworld doesn't always show a "Success" message)._

Step 3: Test It

* Type `/ShowPlayers` in chat. If it shows the list, you are Admin.
* Or try `/TeleportToPlayer [Name]`.

#### ⚙️ Basic Server Settings

You can change the server name and visibility easily.

1. Go to the "Startup" tab.
2. Server Name: Change this to make your server stand out.
3. Server Password: Want a private server? Type a password here.
4. Community Server:
   * ON: Your server appears in the public "Community Servers" list (might take time to show up).
   * OFF: Direct Connect only (Better for private SMPs).
