### 📉 Handling Server Lag & Memory Leaks 🧠

Memory leaks happen when the server's RAM usage keeps climbing until it hits a wall and crashes. While optimizations are improving, here is how to fight back:

#### Step 1: Schedule Frequent Restarts 🔄

This is the #1 way to keep your server snappy. Restarts clear out bloated memory before a crash happens.

* Standard practice: Restart every 12-24 hours.
* Fixing heavy lag: If you're seeing memory leaks, schedule restarts every 2-3 hours.
* Pro Tip: Frequent restarts prevent crashes that often lead to annoying world rollbacks!

#### Step 2: Resource Upgrades ⚡

* CPU Priority: If your server feels sluggish, upgrading your CPU priority allocates more processing power to your node.
* RAM Boost: More RAM delays memory-related crashes, giving your server more "breathing room" to run longer.

### 🔍 Connection & Visibility Issues 🌐

#### Server Not in the List?

If your server is playing hide-and-seek on the community list, check these settings:

* Set a Unique Name: Give your server a specific name in your settings file so it's searchable.
* Search the Right Tab: Make sure you are looking in the Community Servers list, not Official.
* Check Crossplay: Ensure all crossplay platforms are enabled in your configuration so players on different devices can find you.

#### Password Protected Servers

If your server is private, players must check the "Enter password" box _before_ clicking connect. If they don't, they'll be kicked with a "No password entered" error.

### 🩺 Troubleshooting Summary

* Server Lag: Schedule restarts every 2-3 hours and consider a CPU priority upgrade.
* Memory Leak: Upgrade RAM to delay crashes, but rely on restarts for a clean slate.
* Connection Error: Use Direct Connect with your IP and Port as a fail-safe.
