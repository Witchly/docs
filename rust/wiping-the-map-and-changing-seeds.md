# ☢️ Wiping the Map & Changing Seeds

#### 🧹 How to Wipe the Map

1. Stop your server.
2. Go to Files > `server` > `my_server_identity` > `save`.
3. Delete all files ending in `.sav`.
4. Restart the server.

#### 🛠️ Changing the Seed

1. Go to the Startup tab.
2. Find the Level Seed box and enter a new number.
3. Restart. The server will automatically generate a new map based on that number.
